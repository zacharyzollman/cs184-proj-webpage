<h1 align="middle">Assignment 3-2: Additional Features to PathTracer</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Abdul Ali Khan, Zachary Zollman</h2>
    <h2 align="middle">(<a href="https://zacharyzollman.github.io/cs184-proj-webpage/proj3-2/index.html">https://zacharyzollman.github.io/cs184-proj-webpage/proj3-1/index.html</a>)</h2>

    <div class="padded">

        In this assignment, we added features to PathTracer, our rendering tool that implements ray tracing. 
		Specifically, we added the capability to render mirror, glass, and microfacet materials.
		<br><br>
		We encountered some challenges while completing this assignment. 
		For our initial implementation of mirror and glass materials, the glass sphere we tried to render showed up as solid black. 
		We ended up rewriting <code>GlassBSDF::sample_f()</code>, which resolved the issue. 
		The initial version of this function did not calculate η correctly, and likely had other issues.
		<br><br>
		Similarly, when we tried to render a bunny using our initial implementation of the microfacet material rendering feature, the bunny reflected the overhead light as expected, but was otherwise solid black. 
		There were also black dots scattered throughout the image. 
		I went through the code and realized that we were not checking whether the values of <code>wi</code> and <code>wo</code> were valid. 
		After adding these checks, the black dots disappeared. We then got a response to a comment we made on EdStem, which suggested that our <code>wi</code> calculation may be flawed. Indeed, we were not reflecting our <code>wo</code> appropriately. Once I fixed this, the bunny was no longer solid black.


        <h3 align="middle">Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>

		<code>BSDF::reflect()</code> calculates a reflected vector; it negates the x and y components of the incident direction vector <code>wo</code> and copies the z component to obtain the reflection direction, which is then stored in the pointer wi.
		<br><br>
		<code>MirrorBSDF::sample_f()</code> calls the reflect function with the incident direction <code>wo</code> to obtain the reflection direction wi. It sets the PDF to 1 since the probability of reflecting is 1 for a perfect mirror. It then returns the reflectance divided by the absolute cosine of the reflection direction, which is obtained by computing the dot product of the reflection direction and the surface normal and taking the absolute value.
		<br><br>
		<code>BSDF::refract()</code> calculates a direction of refraction for a provided direction vector and index of refraction using Snell’s Law.
		<br><br>
		<code>RefractionBSDF::sample_f()</code> calculates <code>wi</code> using <code>refract()</code>, sets the PDF to 1, and returns a value for radiance.
		<br><br>
		<code>GlassBSDF::sample_f()</code> first checks for total internal reflection. This is the simplest case, and results in us taking the same actions as in MirrorBSDF::sample_f(). If total internal reflection does not occur, then we compute Schlick’s approximation of the ratio of reflection energy to refraction energy. We then “flip a coin” with a probability of heads based on this ratio. If true, we call <code>reflect()</code> to obtain the direction wi, set PDF to the ratio value, and return the ratio value times the same return value we calculated in the total internal reflection case. If false, we call <code>refract()</code> to obtain the direction wi, set the PDf to one minus the ratio value, and return a more complicated value for radiance.

			<br><br>
            Here is an example of a command that was used to generate these images (only the maximum ray depth value was adjusted between images):
			<code>-t 256 -s 512 -l 8 -m 100 -r 480 360 -f "CBspheres.png" ../dae/sky/CBspheres.dae</code>
			<br><br>
			The images show the scene <code>CBspheres.dae</code> rendered with different values of the <code>max_ray_depth</code> parameter. This parameter determines the maximum number of times a ray can bounce off a surface before it is terminated. A value of 0 means that only the rays that go directly from an object to the camera are considered (so no bouncing occurs), while higher values allow for more complex reflections.
			<br><br>
			In the first image, with <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 0, we only see the direct illumination between the light source and the camera. 
			<br><br>
			There are no reflections or shadows, and the image appears flat. 
			<br><br>
			As we increase the value of <code>max_ray_depth</code>, we start to see more complex reflections and shadows. 
			<br><br>
			In the second image, with <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 1, we see direct lighting; the light from the area light source is reflected off the objects in the scene and going to the camera, but we don't see any further reflections. 
			<br><br>
			In the third image, with <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 2, we start to see more complex reflections. We can see secondary reflection on each of the spheres; in other words, you can see each sphere on the other. This is much clearer on the metallic sphere than on the glass sphere. In this scenario, light went between the area light, the scene (such as a sphere), the scene again (such as the other sphere), and the camera.
			<br><br>
			In the fourth image, with <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 3, we can see even more complex reflections, especially the interior of the glass sphere as refraction becomes visible. This makes sense because the light can go between the light source, an exterior surface of the glass sphere, an interior surface of the glass sphere, an exterior surface of the glass sphere, and the camera. We also see light from the area light source that was refracted by the glass sphere appear on the ground. 
			<br><br>
			At the next level, the light that was reflected onto the ground is seen reflecting back onto the blue wall and the bottom of the sphere! We can also see the interior of the glass sphere on the mirror sphere, since it reflected the light that was refracted by the glass sphere.
			<br><br>
			At the sixth image, with <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 5, we can see that the image is brighter, likely due to more rays reflecting around the scene. Some of these could be those that were refracted by the glass sphere, bounced off the ground, and then bounced off other parts of the scene.
			<br><br>
			In the final image, with <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 100, we can see some bright areas at the top of the glass sphere. This makes sense, because light that was refracted by the glass sphere, reflected off of the ground and into the glass sphere, and then refracted by the glass sphere should be reflected in the image when we consider this many bounces.
			<br><br>
			Overall, as we continued to increase the value of <code>max_ray_depth</code>, the image became more and more detailed, with more accurate lighting and reflections. In the later images, we can see fine details such as the texture of the metal sphere. However, as we increase <code>max_ray_depth</code> beyond a certain point, we start to see diminishing returns in terms of image quality, as the additional complexity may not be noticeable.
