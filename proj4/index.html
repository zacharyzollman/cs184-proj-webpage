    <blockquote><b>
      Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.
    </b></blockquote>
    <p>
      In this project, we implemented a real-time simulation of cloth using a mass and spring based system. We built the data structures to discretely represent the cloth, and defined and applied physical constraints on them. We also implemented collisions with other objects as well as self-collisions to prevent cloth clipping. Finally, we used shaders to render the cloth with realistic lighting and shading effects.
    </p><p>
      Some of the interesting things we learned from completing the project are: How to use different types of springs to model the elasticity and rigidity of cloth. How to adjust the positions of masses in the cloth to simulate collisions with other objects. How to handle self-collisions using spatial hashing and collision constraints. How vertex and fragment shader programs work in general. How to use shader programs to implement diffuse shading, Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping, bump mapping, displacement mapping, and environment-mapped reflections for the cloth.
    </p><p>
      We enjoyed this project because it allowed us to create realistic and interactive simulations of cloth that can respond to various forces and environments. We also learned a lot about the physics and mathematics behind cloth simulation and how to optimize the performance and accuracy of the simulation.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      When the spring constant is higher, there is greater spring force, so the cloth is more rigid. When the constant is lower, it is more limp. With the falling cloth, this is particularly visible in the degree of curvature and bendin at the top of the cloth, between the two pinned points. I also noticed that there is some bending of the cloth closer to cloth's vertical edges at the default <code>ks</code> value, but not at the other values. At the higher <code>ks</code> value, it is probably too rigid to allow such deformation, while at the lower value, it may be so loose that all of the deformation occurs near the top and doesn't propagate elsewhere in the cloth. I also notice that the cloth flares out a bit at the bottom at the low spring constant value. This makes sense because there is less spring force holding the cloth in a rectangle, so the stretching at the top can propagate to curving at the bottom as well.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      As with <code>ks</code>, altering the value for density also most noticeably changes the appearance at the top of the cloth, between the two pinned edges. In this case, increasing density increases the effect of gravitational force, so there appears to be greater deformation of the cloth at higher values for density. At the high density value, the curvature at the top is at its greatest, the deformation along the sides that we see with default values is absent, and there is some flaring out at the bottom. At the low density value, the curvature at the top is the most gradual, the deformation along the sides that we see with default values is similarly absent, and there isn't any flaring out at the bottom.

    <p>
      There wasn't very much difference between the resting positions of the cloth for the values of damping that I tried. This makes sense because the only forces were gravity and the pinned masses, which were all constant.

    <p>
      However, the behavior of the cloth was very different once it was released from its starting position. At higher values, the force was highly dampened, so the speed was slow and steady. the cloth fell, fairly uniformly, toward its resting position and stayed there. In contrast, with the lower dampening value, the cloth fell faster and swung back and forth before staying in its resting spot. This makes sense if we consider that the damping force represents friction; an object facing less friction <i>would</i> move faster and swing back and forth more. There was also more of a ripple/dapple/flutter type of pattern on the falling cloth, which makes sense because it would have less uniform forces acting on it if the energy from its motion had more of an effect (rather than almost exclusively gravity and the pinned masses).

    <p>
      When <code>ks</code> is larger, there are fewer folds, and each has more fabric in it and sticks out further from the surface of the sphere. This is logical because when <code>ks</code> is larger, the spring force is stronger, so the cloth is more resistant to folding, so folds only occur over greater areas of the cloth. Thus, we observe larger folds.

    <p>
    By changing the density or of the cloth it alters the weight it has, which in turn alters the amount of force it has to resist folding. When the density is low, the cloth is light and can fold easily. When the density is high, the cloth is heavy and can't fold as easily due to force resisting folding. 
	  The same is true for the spring constant. When the spring constant is low, the cloth can fold easily. When the spring constant is high, the cloth can't fold as easily due to force to resistance to folding.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what a shader program is and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is parallelized and independent from other aspects of the rendering, so it can calculate values affecting the appearance of objects in a much faster manner. We use vertex shaders to compute geometric values like vertex positions and normals. These values are fed into fragment shaders, which compute colors. These values for color and geometry are then used in the rendering.
    </p>

    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Blinn-Phong shading involves three components: ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting. Ambient light is like background light that illuminates surfaces uniformly. We model it as a multiple of constants. Below, it results in the cloth and sphere appearing uniformly dark gray. Diffuse light is core to modeling lighting, and can work on its own, as seen in the first subpart of this part of the project. Essentially, it involves light from a light source reflecting off an object. Below, it results in a matte cloth and sphere. We model it as depending on distance from light source (increasing distance decreases the brightness), intensity of light source (increasing intensity increases the brightness), and the dot product of the surface normal at the vertex and the vector pointing from the vertex to the light source (with increasing dot product value corresponding to greater intensity). Finally, specular light is like shininess, which occurs when and where the light source and the viewer are near a mirror angle, resulting in a larger portion of the light reflecting toward the viewer. More specifically, this occurs when the angle between the vector pointing from the vertex to the light source forms an angle with the surface normal at the vertex that is close to the angle between the surface normal and the vector pointing from the vertex to the viewer. We model this using the vector halfway between the vector for the light source and the viewer. It is similar to how we modelled diffuse light, except it depends on this calculated vector and the surface normal (instead of the light source vector and the surface normal), this value is raised to a (likely different) power, and it is multiplied by a (likely different) constant value.

    <p>
      Bump mapping only changes the coloration, while displacement mapping also changes the geometry of the objects. This is evident in the above images; the sphere with bump mapping is still a perfect-seeming sphere, while the one with displacement mapping is only approximately spherical. It has ridges and valleys on its surface that correspond to the color variation that is displayed in both bump and displacement mapping.
      <br><br>
      Adjusting the coarseness affects the relative smoothness of bump- and displacement-mapped spheres. With a coarser mesh, the sphere with bump mapping no longer appears to be perfect. As a result, the bump and displacement versions look more similar to each other than they did with the previous parameters. With the finer mesh, the sphere appears to be perfect under bump mapping, while it is clearly rougher under displacement mapping. Also, the displacement more clearly corresponds to the (shade-based) texture on the surface with the finer mesh, which makes sense because there are more vertices to displace and thus there is more potential for finer-scale variation.

    <p>
      I was interested in the idea of creating something involving colorful gradients. The "Normal" shading option already did something like this, so I was curious about how I could use other values to accomplish something similar. I played around and noticed that the tangent provided some nice color gradients. However, it didn't vary along a plane, so I added the x- and y-coordinates from <code>v_uv</code>. This introduced variation along a plane, as desired. I then added a little bit of the normal back in, for further color variation to better differentiate different surfaces.
